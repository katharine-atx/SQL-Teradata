# Query examples using the Dillard's transaction database provided by

# Setting a default database..

# In Teradata, use HELP TABLE X, HELP COLUMN X rather than SHOW/DESCRIBE
# Exception is to see primary/foreign key designation. To see this use:
## SHOW table X;
## SHOW here is actually displaying the code that created the table.

# Example:
# SHOW table STORE;

## STORE INTEGER NOT NULL,
## CITY CHAR(20) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC,
## STATE CHAR(2) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC,
## ZIP CHAR(5) CHARACTER SET LATIN NOT CASESPECIFIC,
## PRIMARY KEY (STORE))

# Basic query with TOP (v. LIMIT in MySQL). Note: TOP lacks option to specify a start row and cannot
# combined with DISTINCT.
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM strinfo
ORDER BY city ASC

# Also note, Teradata uses single quotes and <> only (not "" or !=).
