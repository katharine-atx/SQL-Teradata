# Query examples using the Dillard's transaction database provided by
# the University of Arkansas.

# Objective: Understand the different subsets of sku numbers and departments 
# in each of the tables in the Dillard’s database.

# Setting a default database..

# Note on GROUP BY with Teradata: Any non-aggregate column in the SELECT list 
# or HAVING list of a query with a GROUP BY clause must also listed in the 
# GROUP BY clause or an error will be thrown.
# MySQL allows non-aggregate and defaults to "first" (random) instance value.
